This is a simple **Table Hockey** game created as part of learning **Unity Game Engine**.  
The project helped me understand core Unity concepts such as:

- Scene and GameObject management  
- Scripting in C#  
- Physics and collision detection  
- UI elements and basic game logic  

## Features

- Single player gameplay against simple AI  
- Simple physics-based puck movement  
- Basic scoring system  

## How to Run

1. Open the project in **Unity 6**  
2. Open the scene located in `Assets/Scenes`  
3. Press Play

## Gameplay
